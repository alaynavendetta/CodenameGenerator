# Codename Generator 
by Alayna Ferdarko

Created on **15 January 2025**, the **Codename Generator** is here to provide you with random, creative codenames for any mission, project, or investigation. The tool generates codenames by combining adjectives and nouns, and you can save them along with their details to a CSV file for easy access.

### Features:
- **Random Codename Generation**: Generate a unique codename with just one click, combining a random adjective and noun.
- **Save Codenames**: Save each generated codename with additional details like the case or person information into a CSV file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive GUI using Tkinter.

### Installation Instructions:

To set up the **Codename Generator** on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository** or clone it via Git:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codename-generator.git
    ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**:
    The program uses **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface and **CSV** for saving codenames. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if it’s not installed, you can do so by running:
    ```
    pip install tk
    ```

3. **Run the Program**:
    In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the program is saved, and run:
    ```
    python codename_generator.py
    ```
